<p>Tuto kapitolu začneme videm.</p>
<p><video src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Galton_box.webm" width="640" height="360" controls=""><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Galton_box.webm">Video</a></video></p>

<p>Proč kuličky v tomto videu skončí v určitém množství v určitém sloupci? A proč skončí podobné množství kuliček v každém sloupci, pokud bychom kuličky pustili znova? Jak by se počet kuliček ve soupcích lišil?</p>
<p>Pokud si z této knihy máte odnést jednu kapitolu, pak by to měla být tako :). Jak jsme zmínili v úvodu knihy, většina proměnných okolo nás se chová náhodně. To znamená, že může nabývat náhodných hodnot podle nějakého klíče (procesu). Náhodnost může vycházet z faktu, že měříme jenom nějakou část populace (např. výběrové šetření), z fyzikálních vlastností (např. váha součástky vyrobená v továrně nebude vždy stejná) nebo z chyby měření (např. teploměr nezměří stejnou teplotu vždy stejně, ale hodnoty měření budou kolísat okolo nějakého čísla). Pravděpodobnostní rozložení nám pomáhají kvantifikovat a predikovat míru nahodilosti. Typ pravděpodobnostního rozložení, který na popsání náhodnosti uplatníme vychází z našeho porumění vlastnostní rozložení a jeho vhodnosti na daný problém. A vlastnosti pravděpodobnostních rozložení je to, co si v této kapitole ukážeme.</p>
<p>Na začátku jsme řekli, že budeme používat statistické modely a že tyto modely nejsou přesným vyjádřením reality, ale mohou být užitečným popsáním reality. V této kapitole začneme modely používat.</p>
